# Live Object Detection using Python

A real-time object detection application built in Python using **OpenCV** and a pre-trained deep learning model. This project captures video from a webcam or video file, detects objects in each frame, and displays the results with bounding boxes and labels.

## üìå Features
- **Real-time detection** from webcam or video file  
- **Pre-trained deep learning model** (YOLO / SSD / MobileNet ‚Äî configurable)  
- Displays:  
  - Bounding boxes  
  - Object class names  
  - Detection confidence scores  
- Lightweight and easy to run locally
